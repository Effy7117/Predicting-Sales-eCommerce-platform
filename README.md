## Predictng sales of Summer clothes in e-Commerce platform - Wish

Wish is an American online e-commerce platform for transactions between sellers and buyers founded in 2010. The platform personalizes the shopping experience visually for customers rather than relying only on search bar format. It allows sellers to list their products on Wish and sell directly to consumers.

Due to the non-tactile nature of the online products, to attract customers and promote their sales, e-commerce vendors rely more on an alternative group of presented visual and textual information such as product images and titles.

This project identifies product listing strategies, primarily visual and textual presentation, that can help retailers to raise their product sales. The task is to predict the number of units sold of the products. The problem has been solved through a regression model.

Sales of summer clothes in E-commerce Wish - Dataset contains product listings as well as products ratings and sales performance collected from Kaggle. With this, the correlations and patterns regarding the success of a product and the various components can be studied.
